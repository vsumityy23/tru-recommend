## Introduction
TRU Recommend is a sophisticated recommendation system developed using Streamlit. It helps students find projects that match their skills and interests, and assists clients in identifying suitable students for their projects. The system uses state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT, GPT-2, and RoBERTa for embedding generation and cosine similarity for matching.

## Features
- **Student Mode**: Upload a resume or manually enter skills, tools, and certifications to receive project recommendations.
- **Client Mode**: Select a project to get recommendations for suitable students.
- **NLP Models**: Utilizes BERT, GPT-2, and RoBERTa models for generating embeddings.
- **Resume Extraction**: Automatically extracts skills, tools, and certifications from uploaded PDF resumes.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/vsumityy23/tru-recommend.git
    cd tru-recommend
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download NLP models**:
    ```sh
